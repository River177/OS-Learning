# 	OS 笔记

## CH 1 Introduction

- **Virtualization**: The OS takes a physical resource (such as the processor, or memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form of itself.

- **Concurrency**: Many problems arise, and must be addressed, when working on many things at once (i.e., concurrently) in the same program.

- **Persistence**: The OS makes information persist, despite computer crashes, disk failures, or power outages.

## CH 2 Operating-System Structures

**POSIX API**: 规定了文件操作、进程管理、线程、信号处理、I/O 操作等方面的函数和行为。
